# Predicting Business Success Using Machine Learning and Data Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to develop a Machine Learning model that predicts the success of startups. The prediction is based on various features including total funding received, location, and funding rounds. The model was developed after an extensive review of existing literature discussing the factors influencing startup success and the role of Machine Learning in business predictions.

## Data
The data for this project was collected from a public dataset on Kaggle. The "Big Start-up Success/Fail Dataset from Crunchbase" is a comprehensive database containing a variety of statistics about start-ups around the world.
The dataset, which has 66,368 entries total across 14 variables, offers a wealth of information for study and analysis.


## Methodology
The project involved a series of steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Accumulated a broad dataset of startups.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned the collected data and prepared it for application of Machine Learning algorithms.
3. **Model Development**: Designed and trained the Machine Learning model using part of the collected data.
4. **Model Validation**: Validated the model's performance using the remaining data.
5. **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluated the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Results
The trained model was integrated into a user-friendly web application using Streamlit to help various stakeholders in making data-driven decisions, thus reducing the risks associated with startup investments and contributing to the growth of a successful startup ecosystem.

## Prerequisites
The project is built using Python and requires the following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- streamlit
